% Inputs:
%   + map: MxN logical matrix representing the environment map as a binary 
%   occupancy gridmap, 0 (black) are obstacles and 1 (white) free space.
%
%   + sat: double scalar for the saturation value.
%
% Outputs:
%   o F: MxN double matrix representing the velocities map normalized.
%
%   o time: the time elapsed in seconds for computing F.
