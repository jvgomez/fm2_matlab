## INSTRUCTIONS:
Just go to examples folder and run the scripts. They show how to use the code.

Data is structured as follows:
- Algorithms: Main FM2 algorithms, this is the most important part of the code. It is ready to be used out of the Matlab GUI.
- Examples: ready-to-run Matlab functions using the main algorithms in Algorithms/ to show their use without the GUI.
- Data: maps and useful data to test the algorithms.
- fm2tools: auxiliar functions of common use together with FM2 code.
